# Week 11: Notes

- Game Graves
  - Step 1: Collections
    - Recording via screenshots --> DIY kobotoolbox later?
    - Orlémurs Cemetery
      - Coastal location
        - Graves near back area "wild" and drowners linger
      - Beside temple --> graves directly at the temple maintained suggesting field graveyard not in use
      - A bit overgrown
      - Many collapsing/crumbling graves --> nicer near enterance
      - Walled --> wall crumbling at certain places
      - Headstones/Graves
        - Varitey of people buried here --> from traveller to marquis
        - Elven grave of professor robbed --> grave indicated elven bc written in elder speak
    - Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery
      - SO MANY MONSTER FLOWERS
        - ONE SPIT OUT A GHOUL
      - Groupings of overlapping graves
      - Built on rocky/hilly area
      - Very overgrown
      - Big crypt in center that goes underground
      - Headstones/Graves
        - More decorative headstones
        - Some engraved with different language
        - Statues as "headstones" --> all "female" figures lack upper bodies
        - Lots of wealth associated with graves --> literally, tons of loot
          - Also many looted graves
        - Assorted nobles and associated individuals --> still seemingly abandoned
  - Step 2: Look
    - There isn't much data to record --> each grave consists of a name and a quote
      - Further information is gathered through the images themselves --> kobotoolbox more focused on data
    - Not sure if there's a image focused recording tool out there --> for now I am sorting screenshots as follows:
    - Witcher3Graveyards
      - Orlémurs Cemetery
        - Elves, Mages, and Scholars
        - Occupation listed
        - Nobility
        - General
      - Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery
        - Elves, Mages, and Scholars
        - Occupation listed
        - General
    - Based on prior observation, I expect that the Elves, Mages, and Scholars categories might draw paralells to what's found on religious headstones
      - Not particularly --> some inscriptions in different language/Elder speech rather than common speech
      - Professor's grave looted at Orlémurs
    - Cemetaries seem to be a "fun" bit of extra content rather than a focus --> most "inscriptions" jokes
      - Both cemeteries that are readable seem to be abandoned --> others may be implied to be more serious/contain more treasured people considering large number of mourners (specifically at Orlémurs)
    - A number of people died in battle and there are so many monsters everywhere --> burial for the lucky?

- Sonification
  - Want to try this because I didn't get to in HIST3814
  - Concept of computer generated music odd in itself --> data generated music takes this a step further
    - Music typically thought of as coming from the human imagination
  - Will start with Binder tutorial
    - Feel like the required date formatting could be error prone because of one likely needs to alter data to fit format
    - Honestly, not entirely sure how to approach getting my data on par with necessary formatting
      - This seems to be a reoccuring thing *sigh*
  - Two Tone
    - Much easier to use!
    - What if I overlay the comparisons I was trying to do in week 10
      - Anticipate this may be very repetitative and chaotic
      - Yes okay it becomes a series of the same note over and over because the data is a count and there wasn't much over lap with styles vs years
        - Reducing it to decades makes little difference...
    - Arrange elements by date to sonify progression?
      - Total height --> any times with a penchant form grandeur? --> search for decorative-ness of graves over time!
        - Will try to overlay total height, length (for crypts), decorative motifs, quotes, and text panels
        - I feel it may get more elaborate as time progresses because of advancement of machinery
          - Descent it to chaos
        - Flaw: Gaps in data make drawing conclusions harder from this sonification
      - Hm doesn't look like I can modify data in Two Tone --> will quickly sort by date (earliest to latest) in Numbers
        - Conclusion of sonification is all of the graves with unknown dates
      - lmao this sounds like someone trying to make medieval Eastern European music but they aren't entirely sure what that is and they don't have the right instruments
        - A bit boring but not terrible
      - Height (harp) represented by 3x tempo, ascending --> "climb" indicates measurement
      - Will keep quotes as same instrument (glockenspiel) --> looking at if there is quotes present rather than their nature
        - Would be interesting to do a text analysis on quotes and representing that...
      - DO NOT USE OSCILLATOR
        - Oh actually I forgot to change the height variable back and it sounds kind of cool --> vintage nightmare
      - Length/thickness double bass --> represent "low-ness" of tombs/crypts
      - Central deco motifs a church organ --> only 2 occurences apparently so I wanted a very present noise to highlight them
      - Marginal deco motifs violin & text panels are piano --> it sounds nice
    - Overall
      - Quotes remind consistently present --> "hammering" of glockenspiel
      - Late 19th c. actually has the most consistent decoration, contradicting my initial prediction
        - Text panels consistent but trickle out of favour after 1970s --> piano goes lower
      - After note #122, data is of unknown time period --> song should technicallay end at 2:01
    - Thoughts
      - To interpret this is an orchestral listening activity --> need a good ear to identify and interpret the pieces
      - This was by far the most "artistic" interpretation of data I've done --> sounds like the background music of a Professor Layton game
        - Lots of choices made means that I think sonification is the most overtly "influenced" data by those who create it
        - Could this overt influce be beneficial? --> less of a guesing game at finding interpretations vs "fact"
      - Data easier to interpret by looking at the notes in Two Tone rather than listening

- AR
  - I am once again halted by my lack of photos --> what if I tried to model grave by hand then apply photos as textures?
    - Taking advantage of free student [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/) pro account
    - Will import image and model from that
  - Suddenly understand usefulness of Meshroom
    - Can model with this but not apply textures --> will have to port over to Blender probably
    - As pretty-much-beginner, these mechanics are weirddd
  - Okay too much for 1 week, will come back to this
